    <h1> Hello Professor Pinter and perhaps others!</h1> 
    <p> My name is Sophie Parsonnet and I go by she/her pronouns. I'm from Atlanta, Georgia and am planning on going back to Atlanta to apply to SCAD grad school for character design. </p>
    <p> I recently just graduated from CU with a major in <b> Studio Arts</b> with an emphasis in <b> Digital Arts </b> while minoring in <em>Creative Technology and Design</em>. </p> 
    <p> I think anything digital is the future but I am very passionate about safe ways to use technology as there are countless new types of technology that can possibly be misused.</p>
    <p> I once worked a job where I was in charge of resturant's social media and had to do a little but of HTML/CSS so I'm feeling a little ahead of the curve but I'm simply not the best coder. It seriously is like another language to me!</p>  <p> I am a <b> hard worker</b> though, so I'll be doing my best regardless. </p>
